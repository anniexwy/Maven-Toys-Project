# Maven-Toys-Project
Sales &amp; inventory analysis for Maven Toys, a fictitious toy company


### Backgrounds & Goals for the Maven Toys Project


Maven Toys is a company which owns a chain of retail stores across Mexico, and has been selling toys, games, electronics and other types of products for about two years. Martha Quaife, leader of the sales department, has approached you and asked you to help her with her analysis by researching for several key analysis points, so that she can see whether the department should adjust their business strategy.  

The following is a list of the key points she would like to see:

* Total revenue, profit, profit margin, number of purchases and units sold in this two-year period.
* Quarterly trends of revenue and profit in this two-year period. 
* Revenue, profit,profit margin, number of purchases and units sold by city.
* Revenue, profit, profit margin, number of purchases and units sold by the type of location the store is at.
* Revenue, profit,profit margin, number of purchases and units sold by product category.
* Top 5 products (if applicable) which gain the highest revenues.
* Top 5 stores (if applicable) which gain the highest revenues.

Also, it would be better for her if you can present the two top-fives for each city, each loaction type and each product category.

In addition, she is also concerned about the inventory status at this point. She would like you to analyse this topic in terms of costs and units. It would be better for her if you can show her the inventory status by city, and figure out which product and which store are having the most money tied up in inventory.


### Things I did

* Utilized Excel to clean up the data, so that there are no null values which may affect my analysis.
* Conducted analysis according to Martha's requests in PostgreSQL. (You can find the codes in this repository)
* Visualized my findings in Tableau.


*Note: Maven Toys is a fictitious company and the person Martha Quaife is made-up also.
